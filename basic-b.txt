INPUT user's number N 
INPUT computer's input number X 
INPUT counter = 0

If user puts guess then the counter counts +1
If the number of wrong guesses is max. 5 then the game terminates

If the user puts N = X, then the game terminates with success

If the user puts N < X then OUTPUT "your number lower than x"
  if the number of guesses is less than 5 then continue guessing
  else terminate the game
If the user puts N > X then OUTPUT "your number higher than x"
  if the number of guesses is less than 5 then continue guessing
  else terminate the game
